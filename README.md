# Compound Word Search Implementation

* Algorithmic coding problem from Fall 2015
* The program reads a file containing a sorted list of words and returns:
    * 1st longest word in the file that can be constructed by concatenating copies of shorter words also found in the file
    * 2nd longest word found
    * Total count of how many of the words in the list can be constructed of other words in the list

* Compile by running:

```
g++ -Wall *.cpp
```

* Execute by running:

```
./a.out input.txt 0
```

* To generate an output file:

```
./a.out input.txt 1
```

### There is a lot of room for improvement, especially around performance
